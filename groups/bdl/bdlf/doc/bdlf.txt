@PURPOSE: Provide signature-specific function objects (functors).

@MNEMONIC: Basic Development Environment Functors (bdlf)

@SEE_ALSO: bcef

@DESCRIPTION: The 'bdlf' package provides components to implement function
 objects (functors) that return void and take between zero and nine arguments
 of arbitrary type.  Function objects created by 'bdlf' components can be
 invoked in a manner similar to that of the following free function:
..
   void functionObject(arglist);
..
 where 'arglist' contains between zero and nine arguments.  Functor classes are
 differentiated by the number and type of arguments they expect.  The 'bdlf'
 package contains 10 separate components that differ in the number of arguments
 their functors expect; within each component, templates are used to support
 variations in argument type.

 In addition, three components ('bdlf_bind', 'bdlf_memfn' and 'bdlf_function')
 provide more general functors that can conform to a specified prototype and
 return an arbitrary type, and that can be invoked in the same manner as
 before.  The functors created by these two components currently support from
 zero up to 14 arguments.  'bdlf_bind' provides compile-time polymorphism, and
 adapts an invocable object so that it conforms to a different interface and
 can be invoked with fewer arguments and/or with the arguments in a different
 order.  This transformation is type-safe, in that type violations provoke
 compilation errors.  'bdlf_memfn' provides a wrapper that allows a member
 function to be invoked like a free function, either by providing the object
 instance as first parameter, or by wrapping the object instance inside the
 function object.  'bdlf_function' provides run-time polymorphism and is
 especially suited for callbacks because it adapts any invocable with a
 compatible prototype to a specified callback interface, at run-time and
 without the need for recompilation.

/Hierarchical Synopsis
/---------------------
 The 'bdlf' package currently has 3 components having 2 levels of physical
 dependency.  The list below shows the hierarchical ordering of the components.
 The order of components within each level is not architecturally significant,
 just alphabetical.

  2. bdlf_bind

  1. bdlf_memfn
     bdlf_placeholder
..

/Component Synopsis
/------------------
: 'bdlf_bind':
:      Provide a signature-specific function object (functor).
:
: 'bdlf_memfn':

:      Provide a parameterized placeholder and specialized placeholders.

/Related Packages in Package Group 'bdl'
/---------------------------------------
 Package 'bdlf' is designed to use three other packages in 'bdl'.  'bdlf'
 provides the primary interface that a client will see, and the other packages
 play supporting roles.

 The packages are:

: 'bdlf':
:      Provides functors to clients in a canonical form.
:
: 'bdlfr':
:     This package is *DEPRECATED*.  A common reference-counted base class,
:     used by 'bdlfi'.  These classes provide reference counting and object
:     deletion for derived classes.
:
: 'bdlfi':
:     This package is *DEPRECATED*.  Concrete reference-counted function
:     objects, held and managed by a 'bdlf' object; classes in 'bdlfi'
:     implement behavior declared in 'bdlfr'.
:
: 'bdlfu':
:     This package is *DEPRECATED*.  Factory method utilities to initialize
:     'bdlf' functors by creating a reference-counted function object (from
:     'bdlfi') and assigning it to a 'bdlf' functor. Subsequent invocations of
:     the 'bdlf' functor will be delegated to the  'bdlfi' object.

/Relationship to Packages in 'bdl'
/---------------------------------
 The 'bdlf', 'bdlfr', 'bdlfi', and 'bdlfu' packages provide identical
 functionality to the corresponding packages in the 'bce' package group:
 'bcef', 'bcefr', 'bcefi', and 'bcefu', respectively.  The difference between
 the two sets of packages is that the 'bce' packages provide thread safety,
 whereas the 'bdl' packages do not.  In particular, package 'bcefr' implements
 reference counting via atomic operators provided in package 'bces_atomicutil'.

/Functors and Function Pointers
/------------------------------
 Function pointers should be familiar to both C and C++ programmers.  A
 function pointer is a pointer to a C-style function.  In C++, the function
 pointer is declared to point to a function with a specific return type and a
 specific number of arguments of specific types.  For instance,
..
  void (*fp)(int, const char*);
..
 declares a function pointer 'fp' that points to a function returning 'void',
 and taking exactly two arguments, an 'int' and a const pointer to 'char'.

 Assume, then, that we have one or more functions declared with the matching
 signature:
..
  void f1(int x, const char* s);
  void f2(int x, const char* s);
..
 After assigning a value to the function pointer, we can call the corresponding
 function:
..
  fp = f1;
       .
       .
       .
  int my_x = 0;
  int my_s = "Text String";
  fp(my_x, my_s);          // invokes function f1
..
 Functors are objects that behave syntactically and semantically like
 functions.  Functors implement a function-call operator ('operator()') whose
 signature characterizes the particular functor's type.  In this example, for
 instance, we could define a functor like this:
..
  class MyFunctor {
      // Class MyFunctor can be used like a function.
       .
       .
       .
  public:
      void operator()(int x, const char* s);
      // this provides invocation semantics
       .
       .
       .
  };

  MyFunctor fn;
       .
       .
       .
  int my_x = 0;
  int my_s = "Text String";
  fn(my_x, my_s);          // "invokes" functor fn via fn::operator()
..
 Functors provide some interesting advantages over simple function pointers.
 Unlike a function pointer, a functor may be created with one or more arbitrary
 objects (sometimes called "user data") to be passed (typically as trailing
 arguments) to the underlying function.  By "pre-binding" particular arguments
 to the underlying function, a functor can reduce the number of arguments a
 caller must supply when the functor is invoked.  In this way, function objects
 can be used to coerce functions with extra arguments of arbitrary type into a
 standard calling signature.  Even (non-'static') *member* functions can be
 encapsulated within functors and treated uniformly, simply by supplying the
 appropriate object at construction.  Both the *object* pointer and a *member*
 *function* pointer are stored in the functor; the given object pointer is
 dereferenced when the functor is invoked.

/Functors in the 'bdlf' package
/------------------------------

/Signature-Specific Functors
/- - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 Individual components are "numbered" to indicate the number of arguments
 (between 0 and 6) that a particular functor accepts.  Each component defines a
 templated class, whose template parameters correspond in number to the functor
 arguments.  When instantiated, the template argument types match the argument
 types used in invoking the functor.  The component name is 'bdlf_vfunc'
 followed by 0 to 6; the letter 'v' indicates that the corresponding functor
 will return 'void'.  For the example above, we would use component
 'bdlf_vfunc2' to create a functor object whose 'operator()' member function
 obeys the required signature.
..
  #include <bdlf_vfunc2.h>

      bdlf_Vfunc2<int, const char*> fn;  // template arguments specify arg
                                         // types
          // NOTE: This example is incomplete.
          //       We still need code to initialize 'fn'
      .
      .
      .
      int my_x = 0;
      int my_s = "Text String";
      fn(my_x, my_s);                    // "invokes" functor fn
..
 Before a 'bdlf' functor is invoked as illustrated, the client is responsible
 for ensuring that it is valid; that is, it must contain a pointer to a
 function that will be called when the functor is invoked.  The function to be
 called is external to the functor, and supplied by the client.  This "external
 function" may be a free function, a static class method, or a (non-'static')
 member function for some class.  The client, then, needs a canonical
 mechanism, regardless of the function type, to create a reference to that
 function, and to bind the reference to the 'bdlf' functor.

 The most common way to accomplish this is to use a "factory method" defined in
 the 'bdlfu' package.  The 'bdlfu' package contains 10 components which provide
 these factory methods.  Parallel to 'bdlf', these components are "numbered" to
 support functors with different numbers of arguments.  The factory methods are
 also templatized to support varying argument types.

 Each 'bdlfu' component contains 4 different types of factory methods, varying
 by the type of function pointer required.  For example, 'bdlfu_vfunc2' defines
 the following *factory* *method* *families*:
..
  bdlfu_Vfunc2::makeF();    // generate a pointer to a free function
                            // and assign it to a 'bdlf_Vfunc2' object
  bdlfu_Vfunc2::makeM();    // generate a pointer to a member function
                            // and assign it to a 'bdlf_Vfunc2' object
  bdlfu_Vfunc2::makeC()     // generate a pointer to a const member
                            // function and assign it to a  'bdlf_Vfunc2'
                            // object
  bdlfu_Vfunc2::makeNull(); // initialize a 'bdlf_Vfunc2' object with
                            // an empty function
..
 These factory methods (except for 'makeNull') are templatized to support
 different return and argument types; in addition, each *factory* *method*
 *family* consists of a set of overloaded functions that support varying
 numbers of arguments on the underlying functions (member or free).  All
 classes returned by functions in component 'bdlfu_vfunc2' are defined in
 component 'bdlfi_vfunc2'.  See package documentation for the {'bdlfu'} package
 for details.

 For the simple example above, we would use component 'bdlfu_Vfunc2' as follows
 to initialize the 'bdlf_Vfunc2' object:
..
  #include <bdlf_vfunc2.h>
  #include <bdlfu_vfunc2.h>

      void f1(int x, const char* s);
      void f2(int x, const char* s);

      bdlf_Vfunc2<int, const char*> fn;  // template arguments define arg types
      bdlfu_Vfunc2::makeF(&fn,f1);       // bind functor fn to function f1
         .
         .
         .
      int my_x = 0;
      int my_s = "Text String";
      fn(my_x, my_s);                    // "invokes" functor fn
..
 The 'bdlfu_Vfunc2::makeF' *factory* *method* in the above example expects two
 arguments.  The first is a pointer to the functor object itself, and the
 second is a pointer to a free function with a signature matching the functor
 object, that is, expecting args of 'int' and 'const char*', and returning
 'void'.

 The 'makeF()' functions create instances of classes from the 'bdlfi'
 component; the specific classes are determined by the number and types of
 arguments on the 'bdlf' functor and the free function.  Similarly, class
 member functions can be used to initialize a 'bdlf' functor by invoking a
 'bdlfu_Vfunc2::makeM()' or 'bdlfu_Vfunc2::makeC()' function.

 The 'bdlfu' and 'bdlfi' packages will also allow clients to match a functor to
 a free or member function in situations where the function requires more
 arguments than the functor invocation can support.  See the documentation for
 package {'bdlfu'} for details describing how to do this; see package
 documentation for {'bdlfi'} for implementation details.

 Note that because each required argument type 'T' is passed by ('const' 'T&'),
 a compiler will generate an error if the user declares a callback function
 taking an argument via a non-'const' reference parameter.  This is intended to
 support and enforce the rule that all modifiable arguments are passed using
 pointers and not using references.  For rare situations where clients want to
 use a callback function supplied by a third party, and that callback function
 uses non-'const' references, a wrapper function must be declared that converts
 non-'const' references to 'const' references or pointers as appropriate.

/Envelope-Letter Idiom
/- - - - - - - - - - -
 The functors in the 'bdlf' package are implemented using the envelope-letter
 idiom.  The classes in 'bdlf' are *"envelopes"*; classes in 'bdlfr' and
 'bdlfi' are *"letters"*. The use of the envelope-letter idiom allows clients
 to wrap arbitrary functions, whose signatures may differ from the function
 signatures in 'bdlf', with functors that support standard, well-known
 signatures.

 Each 'bdlf_Vfunc*' functor *(envelope)* holds a pointer to an
 object *(letter)* from the corresponding 'bdlfi_vfunc*' component.  The 'bdlf'
 *envelope* forwards or delegates client requests to its *letter* object: in
 particular, the 'operator()' member function used by clients to invoke the
 functor is delegated to the *letter* object for execution.

 The *letter* object is polymorphic: all *letter* classes in a given 'bdlfi'
 component are derived from a common protocol or abstract base class (defined
 in 'bdlfr').  The 'bdlf' *envelope* uses the abstract 'bdlfr' protocol to
 delegate invocation requests.  Different polymorphic *letter* types are used
 to support different external function types and signatures, and the single
 *envelope* type is used to provide a consistent function signature to clients.

 Since polymorphism is used to support different bindings to external member or
 free functions, clients must be able to generate a specific type of *letter*
 object for a given *envelope*, based upon the type and signature of the
 specific external function.  This may be done directly through public
 interfaces of the corresponding 'bdlfi' component, but in most cases it is
 simpler to use a suite of template functions provided by the corresponding
 'bdlfu' package.  Different template functions are provided to match (1) the
 desired function-call-operator signature and (2) the supplied user data.
 Because the C++ compiler will deduce template parameters from argument types,
 clients need not specify them.  See the {'bdlfu'} package for more information
 on populating 'bdlf' functors with specific *letter* objects.

 See also J.O.  Coplien, "Advanced Programming Styles and Idioms", Sections
 5.5-5.6, for a complete discussion of the envelope/letter idiom.

/Binders
/- - - -
 The 'bdlf_bind' component provides a mechanism for creating function objects
 different from the 'bdlf_vfunc*' components.  'bdlf_bind' is used to *adapt*
 an invocable object so that it conforms to a different interface and can be
 invoked with fewer arguments and/or with the arguments in a different order.
 It does this by *binding* some or all of the original invocable's arguments to
 fixed values that are known at construction time and binding the remaining
 arguments to placeholders for arguments that are provided at invocation time.
 A binder can be used as an argument for any template function that requires an
 invocable with compatible parameters.

 The 'bdlf_bind' component defines binder objects and factory methods that can
 bind any arguments into a functor in any order, enabling some of the arguments
 of the invocable to be specified at the construction time, and leaving (via
 place-holders, defined in component 'bdlf_placeholder') some others to be
 specified (later) at invocation time.  A binder is created by one of the three
 *factory* *method* *families* defined in component 'bdlf_bind':
..
  bdlf_BindUtil::bind();   // generate a binder with specified invocable and
                           // bound arguments (invocation arguments are
                           // indicated by place-holders)
  bdlf_BindUtil::bindA();  // same as above but also specify the allocator
                           // used to supply memory for creating the binder
  bdlf_BindUtil::bindR();  // same as 'bdlf_BindUtil::bind()' but explicitly
                           // specify the return type (in case it cannot be
                           // deduced by the compiler but should not be left
                           // undefined)
..
 Binders where the signature of the invocable can be deduced are called
 *explicit*.  Not all binders are explicit.  For non-explicit binders, the
 signature of a 'bdlf_Bind' object is not embedded in the type, and several
 overloads can be invoked through the same binder.  Unlike 'bdlf_Vfunc*'
 objects, different binders accepting the same signature may have different
 types depending on the types of the bound arguments if they are non-explicit.
 The return type (not necessarily void) is also part of the signature.  Thus,
 'bdlf_bind' provides compile-time polymorphism but not run-time polymorphism.

 A broad discussion of binding, along with limitations of the 'usage examples,
 can be found in the component documentation of component 'bdlf_bind'.

/General (Run-Time Polymorphic) Function Objects
/- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 In addition to signature-specific objects and binders, the 'bdlf' package
 provides a run-time polymorphic 'bdlf_Function' template.  A 'bdlf_Function'
 instantiation is capable of holding *any* invocable object of compatible
 prototype, including a function pointer, 'bdlf_MemFn' wrapper, any concrete
 implementation of the 'bdlfr_Vfunc*'protocols, any instances of the
 'bdlf_Vfunc' family, and any other function object having an 'operator()'
 method including an instance of a 'bdlf_Bind' instantiation.

 Like a binder, a 'bdlf_Function' instantiation can have a return value (or
 return 'void').  An instance does not store bound arguments directly.  It
 accepts all its arguments at invocation time only, although using polymorphic
 representations and the 'bdlfu_Vfunc*::make*' factory methods, it is possible
 to bind the last arguments of an invocable and wrap this into a
 'bdlf_Function' object which will then accept only the remaining arguments
 upon invocation.  As mentioned above, it is also possible to assign a
 'bdlf_Bind' object to a 'bdlf_Function' instance to bind and route arguments
 to the invocable in an arbitrary manner.

 Unlike a binder, the signature of a 'bdlf_Function' object is part of the type
 and invocation arguments are cast to their corresponding type before they are
 passed to the invocable.  Most importantly, the same functor may be assigned
 from various types (pointer to function, 'bdlf_MemFn' wrapper, user-defined
 function objects, or even 'bdlf_Bind' binders).

/Functors and Binders
/ - - - - - - - - - -
 'bdlf_Function' objects (functors) and 'bdlf_Bind' objects (binders) are both
 mechanisms for binding arguments and calling an invocable.  They differ in
 their purpose, though.  In the last section, we detailed the main features of
 the 'bdlf_function' and 'bdlf_bind' components.  In this section we point out
 the differences, and how they interact.

 The main difference is compile-time (for 'bdlf_bind') vs. run-time (for
 'bdlf_function') polymorphism.  An instantiation of 'bdlf_Function' is a type
 of functor that can hold any invocable object with compatible prototype.
 Regardless of what type of (compatible) invocable is used to create the
 'bdlf_Function', the type of the resulting functor does not change.  Thus,
 'bdlf_Function' has run-time polymorphism and is ideally suited for callbacks
 because it *adapts* the invocable to the callback interface.  Run-time
 polymorphism is extremely useful for defining callback types and storing
 callbacks, since passing a new type of callback does not require
 re-compilation.  Compile-time polymorphism provides the ability to invoke
 several overloads through the same functor (binder) and to bind and route
 arguments to the invocable in an arbitrary manner.

 In cases where both binders and functors could be used, 'bdlf_Function' has
 certain advantages, not least of which is simplicity (leading to shorter
 compilation times), and the memory optimization documented below, whereby
 small objects are constructed in-place but larger objects are dynamically
 allocated.  Note that binders are always constructed in-place and can have
 rather large footprints.  Functors (including instances of 'bdlfr_Vfunc*'
 derived types) can implement various strategies like sharing and copy-on-write
 to reduce the cost of copying and the footprint at the same time.

/Usage
/-----
 'bdlf'-style functors provide a type-neutral, exception-safe (and
 *potentially*, but not yet, thread-safe) *properly* *managed* alternative to
 the traditional callback paradigm (where "client data" is placed in a single
 structure whose address is cast to type 'void *').  The following example
 illustrates how functor callbacks can be added to a graphical object.

 Let's suppose that the implementor of the 'MyGuiButton' class allows the
 client to specify a callback function that should be called whenever a button
 is pressed.  Furthermore, the implementor agrees to provide to the callback
 function two arguments at its invocation: a modifiable object of type
 'MyGuiContext', and a non-modifiable object of type 'MyGuiLocation'.
..
  class MyGuiContext {
      int d_changedFlag;

    public:
      MyGuiContext() : d_changedFlag(0) { }
      int isChanged() { return d_changedFlag; }
      void changeState() { ++d_changedFlag; }

      // 'MyGuiContext' implementation
  };

  class MyGuiLocation {
    public:
      MyGuiLocation() { };

      // 'MyGuiLocation' implementation
  };
..
 Here is the implementation of the 'MyGuiButton' class:
..
  class MyGuiButton  {
      bdlf_Vfunc2<MyGuiContext *, MyGuiLocation> d_callback;
          // Functor to execute when button is pressed.

    public:
      MyGuiButton(const bdlf_Vfunc2<MyGuiContext *,
                  MyGuiLocation>& buttonPressCallback);
          // Create a graphical button object that executes the
          // specified callback when 'pressButton' is invoked.

      void pressButton(MyGuiContext *context,
                       const MyGuiLocation& location);
          // Execute the callback owned by this button object.
  };

  MyGuiButton::MyGuiButton(const bdlf_Vfunc2<MyGuiContext *,
                           MyGuiLocation>& buttonPressCallback)
  : d_callback(buttonPressCallback) // Retain a "copy" of the specified
                                    // functor.
  {
  }

  void MyGuiButton::pressButton(MyGuiContext *context,
                                const MyGuiLocation& location)
  {
      d_callback(context, location);
          // Execute the contained callback object.
  }
..
 The 'context' and 'location' arguments are mandatory for every function called
 at the press of the button (the number '2' in the name of 'bdlf_Vfunc2' class
 specifies the number of required arguments).  However, we also allow the user
 of 'MyGuiButton' class to invoke the function with a number of additional
 parameters, as in the 'buttonpressFunction' function presented below.
..
  static void buttonpressFunction(MyGuiContext *a,
                                  const MyGuiLocation& b,
                                  int *invocationCounter)
      // This function will be invoked by a functor to increment the
      // specified 'invocationCounter'.
  {
          a->changeState();
          ++*invocationCounter;
  }
..
 The 'bdlf_Vfunc2<MyGuiContext, MyGuiLocation>' class used in 'MyGuiButton'
 class has a private member of an abstract class 'bdlfr_vfunc2', whose
 'execute' method is called when the functor is being called.  The 'execute'
 method of the 'bdlfr_vfunc2' class, the functor invocation operator of the
 'bdlf_Vfunc2' class, and the 'pressButton' method of 'MyGuiButton' class have
 two parameters.  The 'buttonpressFunction' callback function, however, has to
 be called with three arguments.  To achieve the proper calling signature the
 user implements a concrete class derived from 'bdlfr_vfunc2' as follows:
..
  template <class F, class A1, class A2, class D1>
  class FuncRep : public bdlfr_Vfunc2<A1, A2> {
      // This class defines the representation for a function object (functor),
      // characterized by a function-call operator taking two arguments and
      // returning 'void', that holds a pure procedure (i.e., free function,
      // static member function, or functor) taking one additional trailing
      // argument, and this argument's corresponding value.

      F  d_f;  // function pointer or function object (functor)
      D1 d_d1; // first embedded argument

    private:
      // not implemented
      FuncRep(const FuncRep<F, A1, A2, D1>&);
      FuncRep<F, A1, A2, D1>& operator=(const FuncRep<F, A1, A2, D1>&);

    private:
      ~FuncRep()
          // Destroy this functor.  Note that destructor can be invoked only
          // through the static 'deleteObject' method of the base class.
      {
      };

    public:
      // CREATORS
      FuncRep(const F&         procedure,
              const D1&        embeddedArg1,
              bdlma_Allocator *basicAllocator)
          // Create a representation for a function object (functor) taking two
          // arguments and returning 'void', using the specified 'procedure'
          // taking 1 additional trailing argument, and this argument's
          // specified 'embeddedArg1' value.  Use the specified
          // 'basicAllocator' to supply memory.
      : bdlfr_Vfunc1<A1, A2>(basicAllocator)
      , d_f(procedure)
      , d_d1(embeddedArg1)
      {
      };

      // ACCESSORS
      void execute(const A1& argument1, const A2& argument2) const
          // Invoke the underlying procedure (free function, static member
          // function, or functor) with the specified 'argument1' and
          // 'argument2' followed by the argument value specified at
          // construction.
      {
          d_f(argument1, argument2, d_d1);
      };
  };
..
 Note that the required arguments are passed in at the functor invocation, and
 optional arguments are passed in at the functor initialization.  By BDE
 convention, a function signature consists of output parameters, and then input
 parameters.  Since here we have two parameter lists (one passed in by the
 caller, and one passed in by the callee) we can follow this convention within
 each list only.  We choose to pass in first the required arguments (passed by
 the caller) and then the optional arguments (supplied by the callee).  This
 order allows a callee to add parameters easily at the end of the function
 parameter list.  The number of required parameters is a part of the
 'MyGuiButton' interface, and hence will never change.

 The following code shows how we:

: 1 Create the functor representation-(letter).
:
: 2 Create the functor initialized with the representation.
:
: 3 Register the functor as a callback with an instance of the 'MyGuiButton'
:   class.
:
: 4 Invoke the functor.

 The code is as follows:
..
  // (1) Create the representation.

  typedef void (*BpFun)(const MyGuiContext *, const MyGuiLocation&, int *);
  bdlma_Allocator *myAllocator = bdlma_Default::defaultAllocator();

  int globalCounter = 0;

  bdlfr_Vfunc2<MyGuiContext *, MyGuiLocation>  *rep = new(myAllocator)
      FuncRep<BpFun, MyGuiContext *, MyGuiLocation, int*>
          (buttonpressFunction, &globalCounter, myAllocator);

  // (2) Create the functor using the representation.

  bdlf_Vfunc2<MyGuiContext *, MyGuiLocation> callbackFunctor(rep);

  // (3) Register the functor as a callback.

  MyGuiButton button(callbackFunctor);

  // (4) Use the object.

  MyGuiContext gc;
  const MyGuiLocation gl;             assert(0 == globalCounter);
                                      assert(0 == gc.isChanged());
  button.pressButton(&gc, gl);        assert(1 == globalCounter);
                                      assert(1 == gc.isChanged());
  button.pressButton(&gc, gl);        assert(2 == globalCounter);
                                      assert(2 == gc.isChanged());
..
