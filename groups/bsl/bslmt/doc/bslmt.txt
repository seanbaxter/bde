@PURPOSE: Support for multi-threading and thread-safe processes.

@MNEMONIC: Basic Standard Library Multi-Threading (bslmt)

@DESCRIPTION: The 'bslmt' package supports primitives that allow creation and
 management of operating system threads.  Using the components in 'bslmt',
 clients can write efficient, thread-safe code.

 Thread creation and management of mutually exclusive locks (mutexes) are
 supported in a way that should be familiar to developers with experience
 programming in threads on any common computing platform.  In addition,
 individual components such as 'bslmt_lockguard' and 'bslmt_barrier' manage
 synchronization concerns through simple, idiomatic object interfaces that make
 client code easy to read and understand.

/Thread Management
/-----------------
 Thread management is done via the utility class 'bslmt::ThreadUtil' in the
 'bslmt_threadutil' component.  This component presents a platform-independent
 protocol whose operations nonetheless correspond closely to native operations
 on platform-specific threads.  'bslmt::ThreadUtil' presents a procedural
 interface -- that is, clients do not instantiate 'bslmt::ThreadUtil' objects,
 and all methods of 'bslmt::ThreadUtil' are declared 'static'.

 Clients create threads with the functions
 'bslmt::ThreadUtil::create(Handle*, ...)'.  On success, these functions yield
 a 'bslmt::ThreadUtil::Handle' object that provides a lightweight handle for an
 operating systems thread.  Similarly, clients destroy threads for which they
 have a current 'Handle' with 'bslmt::ThreadUtil::terminate(Handle*)'.

 'bslmt::ThreadUtil' supports two 'create()' functions.  The first function
 simply takes a pointer to a 'bslmt::ThreadUtil::Handle'; the second function
 takes a 'bslmt::ThreadAttributes' object that defines component-specific and
 platform-specific attributes of the created thread.  Platform-specific
 attributes include scheduling policy and priority, and thread stack size.  See
 the 'bslmt_threadattributes' component documentation for details.

/Thread Synchronization
/----------------------
 The 'bslmt' package contains several components and classes that support
 thread synchronization in a number of ways.

/Basic Mutexes: 'bslmt::Mutex' and 'bslmt::RecursiveMutex'
/- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 At the lowest level, synchronization between threads is done with
 'bslmt::Mutex', a type defined in component 'bslmt_mutex'.  Locks are
 acquired with 'bslmt::Mutex::lock()' or 'bslmt::Mutex::tryLock()', and
 released with 'bslmt::Mutex::unlock()'.  The 'bslmt' package provides several
 other mechanisms for synchronization and communication, which suit specific
 synchronization problems and allow more idiomatic C++ coding.

 'bslmt::RecursiveMutex' is similar to 'bslmt::Mutex', except that it can be
 'lock'ed multiple times *in* *a* *single* *thread*.  A corresponding number of
 calls to 'unlock()' are required to unlock the mutex.  'bslmt::RecursiveMutex'
 is defined in component 'bslmt_recursivemutex'.

/Inter-thread Condition Variables: 'bslmt::Condition'
/- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 The 'bslmt::Condition' class, defined in component 'bslmt_condition',
 implements a "condition variable" that can be used by multiple threads to
 communicate changes in the condition.  Multiple threads wait on the condition
 by calling 'myCondition->wait(bslmt::Mutex*)', suspending their execution and
 waiting.  An individual thread then signals when the condition is met by
 calling either 'myCondition->signal()' (waking up a single waiting thread) or
 'myCondition->broadcast()' (waking up all waiting threads).  Waits with
 timeouts are supported through 'bslmt::Condition::timedWait()'.

/Locking/Unlocking Critical Code
/- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 Code in multiple threads can create a 'bslmt::Mutex' and call 'mutex->lock()'
 and 'mutex->unlock()' to guarantee exclusive access to critical sections of
 code.  A more idiomatic usage is provided by 'bslmt::LockGuard' and
 'bslmt::LockGuardUnlock'; objects of these types themselves lock and unlock a
 'bslmt::Mutex' when they are created or destroyed, allowing clients to manage
 mutex locks in a way more transparent, safer way, and also making sure the
 lock is released when an exception is thrown within the critical section.
..
  static void myThreadsafeFunction(myObject *obj, bslmt::Mutex *mutex)
  {
      // creating the 'LockGuard', 'guard', calls 'mutex->lock()'
      bslmt::LockGuard<bslmt::Mutex> guard(mutex);
      if (someCondition) {
          obj->someMethod();
          return;
          // 'guard' is destroyed; this calls 'mutex->unlock()'
      } else if (someOtherCondition) {
          obj->someOtherMethod();
          return;
          // 'guard' is destroyed; this calls 'mutex->unlock()'
      }
      obj->defaultMethod();
      return;
      // 'guard' is destroyed; this calls 'mutex->unlock()'
  }
..

/Thread-Specific Storage
/- - - - - - - - - - - -
 Thread-specific storage (also known as thread-local storage, or TLS) is a
 mechanism for referring to a single variable (identified by its 'Key' in
 'bslmt::ThreadUtil', provided by the 'bslmt_threadutil' component) whose
 content varies according to the thread it is observed in.  This is useful for
 status variables such as 'errno', which is implemented by the system as a TLS,
 since otherwise it would be impossible to use 'errno' values in a thread, not
 knowing if another thread had modified it after the last system call in this
 thread.

/Synchronization of Multiple, Parallel Threads: 'bslmt::Barrier'
/ - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 The 'bslmt_barrier' component provides a single class, 'bslmt::Barrier', that
 can be used to synchronize processing among multiple threads.  The
 'bslmt::Barrier' is created with a single argument specifying the number of
 threads to synchronize.  Each individual thread then calls 'myBarrier->wait()'
 when it reaches its synchronization point.  All waiting threads are blocked
 until the required number of threads have called 'myBarrier->wait()'; once the
 required number is reached, the threads are released and can continue
 processing.

/'bslmt' read/write Locking Components
/- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 There are 3 components that provide locking mechanisms that allows multiple
 threads to simultaneously lock for read, while providing exclusive access to
 a thread locking for write.

: o 'bslmt::ReaderWriterMutex': Preferred for most use-cases, has been shown to
:   be faster than 'bslmt::ReaderWriterLock': under most conditions and is
:   generally the best choice.
:
: o 'bslmt::ReaderWriterLock': Preferred only when very long hold times are
:   anticipated.  It also provides 'upgrade*' methods from a locked-for-read
:   state to a locked-for-write state, but the use of this feature is
:   discouraged as it has performed poorly on benchmarks.
:
: o 'bslmt::RWMutex': Deprecated.

 Note that for extremely short hold times and very high concurrency, a
 'bslmt::Mutex' might outperform all of the above.

 Also note that reader/writer locks also have their own guards, provided by the
 templated 'bslmt::ReadLockGuard' and 'bslmt::WriteLockGuard' classes, which
 work on locks of all 3 types.

 Also note that assertions to verify locking are available from
 'bslmt_readerwriterlockassert', which work on locks of type
 'bslmt::ReaderWriterMutex' and 'bslmt::ReaderWriterLock', but not
 'bslmt::RWMutex'.

/Recursive Write Locks: 'bslmt::RecursiveRWLock'
/ - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 This component is *DEPRECATED*.  It can be emulated by a wrapper on a
 'bslmt::ReaderWriterLock' along with a thread-specific counter used to store
 the number of recursive locks acquired by the current thread.

/Static Initialization
/- - - - - - - - - - -
 Initialization of a thread-specific static variable (such as a thread-local
 singleton) can be achieved by using the 'bslmt_once' component.  The
 'bslmt_qlock' component ensures thread-safe static initialization of shared
 resources by providing a light-weight, statically initializable lock.  Note
 that the classic 'bslmt::Mutex' provided by the 'bslmt_mutex' component
 cannot safely be used in static initializations because some platforms (e.g.,
 Windows XP) do not have a native statically-initializable mutex type.

/Implementation Classes and Components
/-------------------------------------
 The 'bslmt' package is supported on all Bloomberg platforms.  In order to
 accomplish this, 'bslmt' provides platform-specific implementations of thread
 primitives.  The following components provide platform-specific
 implementations:
..
             Component           |                 Purpose
  +==============================+===========================================+
  | bslmt_threadutilimpl_pthread | Template specialization for POSIX threads |
  | bslmt_threadutilimpl_win32   | Template specialization for MS-Windows    |
  +------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+
..
 These components are visible and documented.  However, their intended use is
 to support component 'bslmt_threadutil'.  Clients should not expect to use
 them directly.
